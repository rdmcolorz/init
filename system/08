# rsa keys is a private and public keys based on RSA algorithm. Private key is used for
# authentication and a symmetric key exchange during establishment of an SSL/TLS
# session.

# symmetric encryption: encrpyt the messege with key, and send it with the messege

# asymmetric encryption: alice and bob has a private and public key with the RSA
# algorithm. Mailbox is the public key, and private key is the key to the mailbox
# exchange public keys, alice sends the file encrypted with bob's public key, then
# bob can decrpyt it with his private key. Even alice cannot decrypt the messege.

# google cloud manages the keys for you, but it is normally in the .ssh folder
