echo "nat (10.90.1.11)"

# NAT (network address translation) is a method of remapping one IP address space 
# into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets.
# It can be configured to advertise only one address for the entire network to 
# the outside world. This provides additional security by effectively hiding 
# the entire internal network behind that address.
# 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x are public ip address, so ones other then this will
# probably be the one outside the LAN, thus why we choose this one, which is 
# the one prior to the one that doesn't start with 10 or 192.168.
