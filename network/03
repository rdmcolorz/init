ifconfig en1 | awk '/ether/{print $2}'
# en1 refers to wifi card
# MAC address is given to a network adapter when it is manufactured.
#
# the NIC (network interface card) turns data to electric signal and
# transmit it over the network.
#
# so a MAC is given to a NIC when produced. 
#
# use ARP (address resolution protocol) to map IP to MAC addresses and
# vice versa.
#
# awk '/ether/{print $2} prints the second item seperated by spaces on the 
# line with the 'ether' word
